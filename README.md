ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SevorisDoe

This is the GitHub where I host a variety of stuff done under this name; mostly this is stuff related to my work on the [Galactic Library project](https://www.galacticlibrary.net/wiki/Main_Page)
and the ToughSF discord. That means stuff that appears here is: 
- further material used on GalLib, especially any files related to graphics produced for articles there 
- software tools created for one or the other interesting topic related to those spaces 

#### Topics of interest
Stuff that may appear on here in the future 
- More illustrations about wormholes and wormhole networks, especially focusing on some interesting geometries and behaviors  
- illustrations for other topics 
- A software solver for exploring possible wormhole network configurations in varying stellar geometries 
- Other software tools for exploring interesting optimization spaces 
- maybe the odd write-up for Stuff.
